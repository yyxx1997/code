It was a game he'd play with himself, glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back. If he didn't know better he'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman, or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling. \n His face was portly and unshaven, in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard.

Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity. It wasn't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger. Still sharp enough to cut. \n \"DiCaprio.\" The curse rasped out of him in a choke. After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there. Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there. He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he'd be done, but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he couldn't get rid of the money. Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him. \n Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor. \n His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room.", "The window was smashed.

He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail, wind streaming in the half-open window, playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back.

He lifted her into his arms and tried to run. His boat shoes had long since flown off, and the broken glass crunched deeply into his feet. He hobbled along, unwilling to accept the inevitable. Looking over his shoulder he saw the reaper keeping its grim pace, arms outstretched and dead eyes unseeing. \n \"Damn you!\" he snarled, as he struggled onwards. \"Damn you, you -- you fucking monster! You *freak*! Fuck you, fuck you, I'll kill you somehow, I swear it, please don't, please --\" and as his threats devolved into pleas he slipped, falling to his knees. He gave up. It was done. He had made it barely 10 feet. There was nothing left he could do. Faintly, he heard the baby crying. The reaper came on. It had never fallen behind. Finally it reached them and gently, gently, took her soul in its arms, its bony limbs passing through Ray's own, and disappeared. In Ray's arms, his wife let out her last breath.", "He was finished.

He looked up, arms raised. \n \"Look man, I'm sorry,\" he began. \"I -- I don't know what happened, it just --\" Ray began beating him. With every punch he imagined he was killing himself. Tears streamed down his face. Every strike drove shards of glass deeper into his hands. He focused on the pain and ignored the man's steadily weakening pleas.

Then he began punching him again.", "Out of the corner of his eye, Ray noticed something. There was a reaper creeping nearer.

Soldiers should fear their commanders; it was the right way of things. Position alone does not give one the right to lead. Excellence alone is not a reason to be followed. If you intend to rule, your subordinates must see your strength, and submit to it. Anyone who thought differently was either misinformed or simply a fool.

The public transportation was and still is fantastic, so I was alone when I rode the double decker bus back home. When I got to the nearest station to my home, I began to walk towards the subway tunnel, which led to the pathway to my house. The path to my house was under this long canopy of trees, and was squeezed into a thin lane between the trees and a wall right behind the trees - basically you could only walk on this path. The path extended past this sort of village place, then went on towards a cul-de-sac. The cul-de-sac was where I lived, and took about an hour to get to. It was a long but nice walk.", "Unfortunately there were a lot of wild dogs around that area, and I had an almost pathological fear of dogs ( I think I was bitten by one when I was really young and I kept that fear ). At that moment in time though I only ever heard the dogs' barks; at that moment I had never seen a wild dog. Today though, I spotted a dog lying on the pathway in front of me. First reaction was to be quiet and just step over it, since I didn't have enough space to go around. But when I actually got to the point of doing the act, I stopped. It was probably smarter to just wait for the dog to wake up and leave. So I turned around and began to walk back. But then I heard growling behind me.", "Somehow I had woken up the dog ( I think I stepped on it's tail by accident ), and it was mad at me. So, faced with the danger of being bitten, and with faded memories of other encounters with dogs rising up, I chose flight and began to run. Of course, my stubby legs couldn't outrun the fully grown dog, and it caught up to me quickly. Realising the situation I was in, I decided to turn around and fight the dog. So I promptly tried to punch its nose with my right hand, but instead got it caught in the dog's mouth. Fear of the dog wasn't ruling me anymore, and I bit the dog back. Dog whimpers and runs away, but leaves me with a bleeding hand - and the possibility of a disease. It also hurt a lot and I was still an hour away from home. I was happy that my bag was safe and sound though.", "So I began to walk home. But about five to ten minutes after I began walking, I met a nanny ( they're pretty common in Hong Kong ). She had headgear, so she was from Indonesia. She was also pulling an empty little cart that was probably meant for groceries. When I walked up to her she made a gasping sound and began talking Cantonese to me. I was an expat's child though and didn't understand. She then dropped her little trolley, and lifted me up in both of her arms. She stuttered out the words, \"Come with me, I have bandaids.\" I just nodded and let myself be carried off down the pathway. She lived in the village that the path passed by, and so only took a minute or so to reach. She brought me into her employer's house and sat me down. She gave me a phone and motioned to call and said, \"Parents.\" Then she went into another room while I called my parents.", "I told my mom what happened, she sounded flustered and told me that she would come pick me up in her car. The nanny then came back from the room she was in and was holding some alcohol, some paper towels, and those long white, wrapping bandages. She wiped off the blood that caked my hand, and added a liberal amount of the medicinal alcohol. She honestly added too much in my opinion. It honestly stung more than the bite... Anyways, she then wrapped those bandages around and told me to sit tight for my parents. My parents arrived, and I left.", "I guess some people might say everything the nanny did was expected, and that anyone would do such a thing. But she could have easily ignored me, and that's what I probably would have done: I would think the person doesn't want my help because that person isn't asking. The nanny's speed of reaction, and her willingness to do all those medicinal acts will probably always be stuck in my mind. Even if what she did was minimal.

Actually, I think the day before the lowest, because the lowest was the next morning. On the day I tried to die, I was really depressed. Clinically depressed, it's called. Every thought I had revolved around what a terrible person I was, how I deserved to die, how I wanted it to just end.

I didn't know I was going to jump. I definitely didn't go there to jump.", "And then I lay there for a really long time, and the physical pain started, and you know what? I felt a lot better. I really hurt, physically, all over. It made the endless thoughts finally shut up for a while. I was thinking this is it, I am dying. I couldn't smell any blood, or really feel anything either, other than that I was hurt. I was just lying there while people moved around, cleared the platform, rolled the train forward.", "The other passengers were really angry and upset. I couldn't make out words, but they didn't sound happy. I should have gone for paracetamol, except I didn't actually plan to kill myself at all. It just sort of happened. Anyway, the lights came back on and I had police looking down at me. I was blinking in the lights and one of the men swore and then went and threw up. It really stank. Another man kneeled down and asked if I could hear him, and I said yes, and a woman was talking into her radio, but I couldn't make it out. The police man told me not to move. And eventually paramedics came and put me in an ambulance. They made me not look at anything. All I could see was yellow blocks either side of my head, and this woman's face, a paramedic, telling me I was going to be okay. I met her again later on and I didn't recognise her until she said hello, and then I burst out crying.

I did get to see a psychiatrist without a referral. Most people were really good about it. I just felt so awful about what I'd done to everyone and how much time I'd wasted. I got lots of post, but nobody would let me read most of it. I got a lot of hate mail and threats, and my parents got it too. Dad was shouting at me how I was ruining things for him and mum, how they were going to have to move and it was all my fault, and then some nurses came in and he left and I didn't see him again, or mum, or anyone really.

I missed not feeling anything and not giving a damn. And I spent a while in a loony bin, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, even with all the nutters. It was mostly really boring. I talked about what had happened and after a couple of weeks I was let out to go into therapy, CBT. I can't remember what it stands for, but you think different about things and it helps put life in a different aspect, and it's really good if you can keep going to it.

I didn't tell anyone, and I feel really crappy that nobody checked up on me, even at therapy when I missed going. I just sort of slipped through the net. I definitely took enough pills to die. It was more than a thousand.", "Anyway, that was when I realised I couldn't die. I could be hurt, but I always got better really quickly. Slower for poison, quicker if I really fucked myself up. It got a bit mad after that, after more people realised what was going on and I hit the national press. I didn't have any money, and I didn't know what to do with all the post. I couldn't get any emails or go on Twitter.", "People offered me loads of money for my story. There was this one reporter, he was from this terrible newspaper, and I thought it would be awful talking to him, but I thought back then I deserved to feel awful all the time. But he was really nice, and I just opened up about everything that was going on. Just talking about it, what was going on and why I kept trying to kill myself, it helped. Like, I realised it just wasn't ever going to change. I realised that the only time I was actually properly happy was when I was getting things together for another attempt, because that was the only time I was really looking out for myself. It's screwed up, but I felt terrible and I was just trying to feel better.", "Anyway, this reporter said there's all this evidence that you just can't die, so why not do some stunts? I think he said have you thought about going into stunts or extreme sports. But you need to be really fit for those, and if I was motivated to get fit, well, I wouldn't be depressed, would I. But I did get a camera and start putting the videos on YouTube. I got in so much trouble for that. Liveleak was showing them, but I wasn't getting a penny, then someone offered to set up a domain, and the advertising, and I could afford a lawyer just with interviews. I did twenty videos before I gave up. I got some really weird fans.", "So it was after all that, that's when that reporter got back to me. He'd been doing this bit about how people doing hazardous clean up on things like nuclear accidents and chemical accidents die really early, and he thought of me, but we couldn't work out how to sort out training. But that was the first time I actually had something I wanted to really do, and it turns out it makes all the difference.", "I really got into the CBT, and tried different pills which were horrible, but I was warned they could be. I just kept trying new ones until I found one that worked and didn't make me fat or a zombie. Six months after getting onto sertraline I was getting my life back together. I stopped doing the videos, and people forgot really quickly that I even existed. I tried with the fire department and the army. That reporter was amazing, he knew all these people. He wanted to make a long feature out of it, but I think if he hadn't cared at least a little he wouldn't have worked so hard to get me on the right path.", "And now I've got a life.

But I couldn't make it. Death was right there, in all her glory! She was just like what I heard. Fiery red hair, curvaceous body, shining green eyes. She was one attractive lady. I recalled learning that before LoNs took on the human form, Death was perceived as some skeleton, dressed in black and holding a scythe. I couldn't understand how anyone could think that way. Death was full of love. She loved everyone, perhaps to the point where it was too much and she got possessive. But she was vibrant with love and confidence bordering on arrogance. How could anyone think Death would wear black? I took a step towards her, wanting to talk.", "I then noticed that Death wasn't just enjoying the party. She was having an argument with Life and Inertia. I hesitated, not wanting to get caught up in a fight. Too late, Death turned towards me with tears in her eyes.

The prisoner that resided lay upright on his bed, staring at the ceiling. Yet another Super Villain caught by a Super Hero. \n \"You'll be wanting some sauce with that, am I right!?\"", "Yelled the guard as he waddled away down the corridor, laughing boisterously as he turned to meet his colleagues in the office/poker room. \n \"When I get outta here fatty, you'll be eating those words\" \n Whispered Commander, sighing as he watched the grey gunk pulsate on the plastic tray. \"Food like that should never move\" he thought, \"and it especially shouldn't be doing that\". He threw a nearby book at the tray hoping the food would scurry away to disgust some other poor soul, because he sure as hell wasn't going to eat it. \n Suddenly the cell began to vibrate. The tray on the floor, the bed, the shelves, everything began to move and shake. The Commander covered his eyes as sparks began to flash in the middle of the cell, and a blinding light followed from an opening in thin air. The light grew brighter as the opening grew wider and a loud creaking noise followed, echoing down the corridor. The light subsided and a tall figure caped and clad in majestic armor, stepped out of the opening. A wave of his hand caused the creaking to start again, before thuddng as the opening closed itself. The figure stood up straight and his eyes glowed a bright blue through his helmet visor. \n \"Greetings fellow Villain!\" Bellowed the strange figure, \"fear not, for I am your salvation!\"", "The Commander stared in awe at this strange being who materialised before him, hundreds of questions flooding his mind, but no words could escape his mouth. \n \"I see you are in need of answers\" said the knight \"well I shall give you 3 questions so be quick about it, I haven't got all day\" \n The Commander snapped out of his trance began to stutter. \n \"Er -- erm well. I-I-I guess my first question is how the hell did you get in here!?\" Asked the Commander, now rising from his bed. \n \"Oh, I wasn't expecting that question first, but very well!\" Said the knight, holding out his armored hand to demonstrate. \"That was what I like to call my Doorway. I can create small doorways from one place to another\" he said, creating a small portal in the space above his palm, complete with creak and light, like a door opening into nothingness. \"I simply opened a door from my lair to here, and we'll here I am. Please do not ask me how it's done. I have neither the time nor the patience to explain the power to every villain I free\" \n \"Free!?\" Quizzed the Commander, his eyes widening in excitement \n \"Okay! Second question! That's right, I'm here to free you, you poor sad man!\" The figure laughed, brushing aside his tattered cape and revealing a large leather-bound book. The book appeared to be old but upon close inspection, it was just made to look old. He opened the book and cleared his throat. \"Now then, you are The Con --\" \n \"Wait wait wait, who the hell are you?\" Interrupted the Commander \n \"Oh, okay then, third question it is.\" He answered closing the book again. I, dear boy, am the Keymaster! Master of Locks! Conjurer of Doors! And the KEY to the victory of the Villains in this city! \"He opened the book once more, this time equipping a pair of reading glasses in front of his visor, and reading from it nonchalantly.\" Ahem! Now then, you are The Condiment Commander, correct? You were attempting to rob a safety deposit bank on the 18th of July, exclaiming that the law would never, and I quote, Ketchup with you, when you were foiled by leader of the Solar Squadron: Final Flare. That right? \"\n\"...... yes \"admitted The Condiment Commander, begrudgingly. \n\" Right then! \"Said the Keymaster, slamming the book shut and taking his glasses off,\" well despite your below-average evil-doing success rate, and your ranking in the Villain's guild database, I have a feeling that the villains of this city will still need your unique......... skills? During the final face off with the heroes that plague this wretched place. Don't you want to even the score with that Final Flare. This is your chance, boy! \"\n\" Final face off? Even the score? The heck are you talking about? \"Questioned The Commander \n\" I'm sorry but all three questions have been answered, but don't worry all will be explained once the villains have all gathered \"he waved his gauntlets over the Commander's cuffs, opening them with ease, then with another wave opened up a portal.\" Now come along, my time is precious.

All completely bonkers!\" He softened after a moment and brought a hand up to stroke his beard. \"A few of them have gotten close though,\" he mused. \"It's funny, really. Science gives me less and less places to hide, and so do the faithful, and they're both wrong.\" He sighed a small chuckle and wistfully gazed out across the landscape.", "All of a sudden he seemed deep in thought, and I forgotten.

On the other hand, I didn't appear to have anything else to do, or anywhere else to go.

Or out of the world. Just give it your best, that's all I ask.\" \n \"Ok, but wait.\" God raised his eyebrows indulgently, a small smile on his face. \"If everyone has always been wrong, does that mean that whatever answer I can come up with will be wrong too? Is it possible to be right?\" \n \"Not at all. People have described me before as being ineffable. Which, as the logic follows, means that I can, in fact, be effed. It's just that no one has hit the nose yet.\" \n \"Ok,\" I mumbled, and tried to muster some confidence. Then I had another question. \"What about when people refer to you metaphorically, does that count?\" \n \"If we're thinking of the same thing then no. Much too vague.\" \n \"Ok. Interesting,\" I drew myself up, to convince myself more than He. \"So, if, if everyone has always been wrong about you, that would mean that you're neither all-powerful nor not-all-powerful, and the same with your omniscience. You are not the Creator, nor do you comprise some essence of the universe, you do not represent truth or goodness, nor do you have any special covenant with man. Oh, wait, that means you did not make us in your image either. So why do I see you like that?\" \n \"Ah, there's a trick to that but I'm not giving you any hints.\" \n \"Oh. Ah, you mean, you did not make us, someone else did. And they made us in your image. Which would explain Jesus not being your son either.\" \n \"Hm, you are clever. Go on.\" \n \"No, I think I've got it.\" \n \"My my! Slow starter but clearly not just a pretty face!\" \n \"Well it all came together when I remembered Acts 17:25, which says: **'Nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things.'** I mean the second part is clear enough, just look at the world as it is, it's pretty miserable. But the first part would mean that you are served by us, and you do *need* something. So, taking everything else together, here's my idea.\" \n \"Yes, I'm listening.\" \n \"The Universe was created for you by someone else, and all of the things inside it as well. You were placed here, and left alone, which means that you are all-powerful here but that's only relative because it's your universe and whoever created it for you is actually more powerful but they're not here. Furthermore, they gave you the Earth and humanity in your image and left you alone to care for us. You don't have a covenant with us, but you are beholden to the one that put you here. My Lord, you are *doing time*!\"", "God's lips were pressed together in a grim expression, his eyes narrow and hooded. I hesitated to continue, but realised that really, I had nothing to lose. \n \"The universe is your prison. You have to take care of us, for how long I don't know. Maybe forever, as long as forever lasts here. We look and act just as you do because that makes you identify with us, you can't help but be involved with our progress. If you don't take care of us, and learn from all our faults, and reconcile yourself with whatever crime you committed or other reason why you were put here, then you'll never get out. Whatever happens to us after that, I don't know.\"", "I stopped then, having run out my train of thought.

The alarm and it's rush of consciousness washed out whatever directions his subconscious wrote him, like high tide to a message in the sand. If he stared long enough into the abyss of his eyelids he could make out a few letters here and there, but the light of the waking world would wash away all of it soon enough. It was nice just to have the ability to dream again, even if the dreams weren't the best. It was nice to have a relationship with his subconscious again. Order is organized but chaos is beautiful.", "Still, the sleep world called him. He could hear some faint sound of warning echoing up from the depths of his grey matter. It's tone matched the overcast sky, like that of a mother weeping over her lost child. The air of the waking world was thick and ominous. The silence a deep trough awaiting a crest of contrast. The ocean of awareness was sucking in an undertow, compounding itself into a wave that could crush him into sand or carry him to the shore. Sanity is calm but mania is alive.", "He resisted the urge for more sleep and stood up at the foot of his bed. Another aimless day with no plans to be made. The 12 hours of waking time that lay ahead seemed to make finite an infinite amount of dull nothingness. Today was a different one than yesterday. He knew that much, but that was more than he had known for a long time. 2 weeks ago every day felt the same. The clouds that blocked the sky once made up a fog that he lived in, day in and day out. Over the past week they had lifted from him to the sky. Soon, the sun would melt them away and rid them from his existence. He hoped. The light is warm but darkness is soothing.", "He walked into the kitchen and surveyed his options. No coffee. Watch the amount of sugar. Even gluten was encroaching into the category of possible disturbances. He played by their rules with an apathetic conformity. They liked to act like they knew what was going on, but no one really did. He was developing a good picture, he just had to make sure not to lose himself in the darkroom. This week and a half was the first break from the script he could muster, and he erased words and rewrote lines in light pencil, not daring to use a pen yet. He left the kitchen with the same empty hands and empty soul as he had entered with.", "He approached the bathroom with a sense of apprehension. The air was thicker here. The silence a deafening pitch of white noise. The weeping voice called out from where he'd left it in his bed with each step closer he took, the only noise to pierce the screaming silence. Two steps from his bathroom door, he looked back at his bed and could almost make out the veiled mistress that pleaded for him. His animal curiosity sparked embers of interest in his otherwise lifeless eyes as his brain automatically attempted to make sense of the world by assigning causes and effects, but the dullness of his waking life turned blunt any blade attempting to arouse his mind. He knew himself well enough to identify the source of the silence and the shrieks without any effort. It had been long since he last lost himself, but he could stand apart from it now. That was the difference this time.", "He stood and soaked in the shrieks like rays of sunshine, breathing in their hidden music like a grove of lavender. She screamed louder at that. Their was a desperation to her pitch - a desperation of potential failure. Whatever her aim, his taking pleasure in her presence made her increase intensity, but his awareness at this slowly weakened her cries. A smile crawled up his cheeks, turning down the volume with each wrinkle of skin until she washed into the white noise. A full grin spread across his face now. It feels good to be alive again, doesn't it?", "He approached the bathroom door with a newfound sense of control. The crest awaited him. As he looked into the mirror, a maniacal slant took over his grin. \n Welcome back", "Back? I never left. I knew you would reawaken me eventually. We're soulmates. You can't walk away from your soulmate \n Soulmate? Interesting. I don't think I've ever thought of it like that. \n Oh but it's just the best way to see it! Don't you think? We just go so well together. \n You're right, I do think we make a great pair.", "See? Oh I knew you would come around eventually!

Oh no - I would never! That was punishment, by your own hand - don't you remember? You need to listen to me, I know best. \n You know best?", "Oh but of course! Don't you think? You just said that before - we're soulmates, remember? I know best so you know best, that's how this works! You just need to make sure you listen to me.. To save you from yourself... You're sick, remember? \n I'm sick? I don't have a cough, or a fever...", "Oh hahaha no, no no - sick in the head, remember? You're damaged and hurt, that's why I'm here! I know best. Let me help you.", "The clouds from the overcast started to sink with the weight of rain. The rumblings of thunder came from their depths with a ravenous hunger. \n His head started to hurt as the shrieks came back from the room. \n Yes. I know best. Let me help and make this all go away. This is why I'm here..", "No. No no no. NO! NO, you are a crutch! You're not here to help, you're here to hurt the world for me! You're here for revenge, revenge for an unfair world!", "Ooh I like this passion in your voice! Give me your fire! Show me the rage that burns in our soul! The maniacal grin returned and a shadow reached down from his brow to cover his eyes.", "The thunder consumed the clouds and winds rocked the bathroom. A tornado tried to rip him from the earth. The shrieks increased in intensity and threatened the sliver of peace he clung to. \n No.. No...", "He remembered the control he had before entering the bathroom. He remembered the music hidden in her voice, the beauty of the chaos in his mind. He remembered how his smile deafened her cries and made her cry out more, made her cry out in desperation. There was a reason this day felt different. He brought something back with him from his subconscious, a piece of himself that had won their last confrontation, a piece of himself that he had buried in the fog of medication. If he wanted sunlight, he would need to emit it himself. \n I am done with you. My world is a product of my own creation, and you no longer have a place in this.", "And he closed his eyes and silently hummed to himself a frequency that arose from within.

He watched us with amusement, waiting for my answer as I stalled, pretending to look for something in my car. I felt a tug on the back of my coat and turned to see two beautiful brown eyes peering up at me. \n \"Don't be a chicken, Ian,\" those eyes make my stomach flutter and her voice clears my head of any intelligent thoughts. I shut the door behind me and take in the girl before me, Lucy, honey-colored hair draped around her shoulders, and a loose-fitting sweater over tight jeans. We'd been playing some kind of cat-and-muse game for a few weeks now and of course, Steven invited her along to try and bend me to his will in some way. Only now did I see in what way. \n \"I'm really not sure I want to spend the night in the old abandoned hospital,\" I mutter, tearing my gaze from hers to look up the hill at the decrepit building.

I'm sure there'll be beds in here somewhere. Don't be such a bitch, dude.

What the...\" \n \"Strap on, huh?\" I jumped as Lucy's voice sounded behind me. \"What's that mean?\" \n \"Uh, nothing! Something Steve said.\" I rubbed my neck, hot with embarrassment while Lucy's eyes flashed in the moonlight and a smile played on her lips. \n \"Well, if that's what he's into, I guess. C'mon, let's catch up.\" She dashed around me and squeezed through the gap between the gate and I noticed everyone had moved ahead while we'd had our short exchange. I looked up at the gate before passing through. *The old Arkham Mental Hospital... Closed down fifty years ago once they investigated the place for abuse of the patients. Who knows what we'll find in-* A voice calling for me to hurry up interrupted my thought. \n \"What the hell?\" I muttered before running to catch up to the group. Jake and Steven shoved into the front door, pushing all their weight to force it open as I arrived. The door ground against the floor of the foyer, sending a shower of dust into the air as it scraped against the tiles. We all squeezed through and Steven produced flashlights from a bag I hadn't noticed him carrying. \n \"In case we decide to split up, we'll each have a light.\" Steven passed them around and flicked his on, shining it under his chin to cast strange shadows over his face. \"Are we ready to descend into *unknown HORRORS BELOW...\" * He spoke with an inflection like Dracula, throwing his voice around the halls around us in a gloomy echo. \n \"Let's just move on, dork,\" Cindy teased, shoving him playfully. He chuckled and we began our trek, wandering the halls aimlessly. After checking a dozen rooms with no impressive findings, Cindy sighed. \"This is boring,\" she mumbled. \n \"Well, this place is abandoned. What did you expect?\" Steven replied. \n \"I don't know, something exciting, I guess. I heard there were like, tunnels connecting to the sewer in this place.\" \n \"Where the hell did you hear that Cind?\" \n \"I don't know. I heard some of them go straight to the bay. Why don't we look for those?\"", "She looked at Steven expectantly and he scanned the hallway before nodding. \"Can't hurt. How do we find these tunnels?\" \n \"I don't know.\" Cindy shined her light down the hall in both directions while Jake began flashing his into different rooms. \n \"Where did Emily go?\" He asked. I looked around but there was no sign of her. \n \"What? Where did she go?\" I repeated Jake's question. \n \"I bet she's trying to scare us.\" \n \"Isn't that your job, Steve?\" Cindy remarked, smirking at him. \n \"You're right. Em, you're not allowed to scare us!\" Steve called, cupping his mouth with his hands. \"That's my jo-\" A shrill scream interrupted him, freezing all of us in place. We shined our lights in unison down the hall toward the source of the scream. they all converged on a broken flashlight, smashed on the floor. Jake sprinted down the hall and we followed, Jake shouting Emily's name. \n \"Jake, she's probably just screwing with us,\" Steven said as we caught up to him. He was kneeling by the broken flashlight, staring at fresh blood stain spattered on the floor around the flashlight. We heard another scream cut short by a deafening *boom* and Jake bolted down the hall, screaming his sister's name. I followed him and stopped short at the sound of commotion behind me. Steven was curled up on the floor, cradling his knee. \"I tripped. Don't sweat it, just find Emily.\" His expression was contorted with pain but with Cindy at his side, I decided to grab Lucy's hand and pull her along with me after Jake.", "I tried following his cries for Emily but eventually the echoes were playing with my ears as they rolled in from every direction. Lucy seemed turned around as well, spinning as she tried to discern where Jake might've went. \"Did you see where he ran?\" I asked. Lucy just shook her head, her eyes wide with fear. \"Maybe we should go back and get Steven?\"", "Lucy was about to speak when we heard Jake's voice again, this time clearly coming from down some stairs up ahead. I pointed the light down the stairs, the winding staircase walled with bricks as it headed underground. \"Maybe these lead to the tunnels Cindy was talking about?\" Lucy said, tugging my sleeve. \"Maybe Emily went into the sewers.\" \n \"Went or was taken?\" Lucy stared at me with a frightened look and I pt a hand on her shoulder. \"Sorry, I'm just scared. Let's go back and find Steve and Cindy.\" \n \"What about the stairs? What if we get lost and can't find them again?\" I studied the staircase for a second before taking my flashlight and placing it on the ground, pointing it the way we'd come. \n \"There. When we see the light, we'll know.\" \n \"I don't know how I feel about that idea.\" Lucy handed me her flashlight and looked back down at the one I'd placed on the floor. \n \"It'll be fine, let's just go.\" We retraced our footsteps back the way we'd come, hoping we'd remembered all those twists and turns. I was just beginning to think we were lost when I stepped on something round that nearly made me slip and fall. I pointed the light down to see Emily's flashlight where we'd left it. Steven and Cindy were nowhere to be found. \n \"Where are they?\" Lucy demanded, the fear in her voice more than noticeable. \n \"Don't freak out. Maybe they left to get help. C'mon, let's see if they're outside.\" We trudged back to the entrance, a straight shot down the hallway we'd first come down. However, upon reaching the foyer, we hit a dead end on an empty wall. \"What the fuck?\" I dragged the light over the wall's surface, trying to locate the entrance. The wall was blank, no windows, doors, or paint. \n \"I don't understand, this is where we came from. Where the hell did the door go?\" I heard the sound of something rolling on the floor and turned to see another busted flashlight as it tapped my shoe. I pointed my light down the hallway and spotted a shape disappear around the corner where we'd found Emily's flashlight. \n \"Did you see that?\" I demanded. \n \"See what?\" Lucy cried, grasping my shirt. \n \"Fuck, I don't know,\" my voice exposing my own fear. \"Let's find a door. Okay?\" I started walking along the wall, but the halls ended with rooms filled with broken cupboards and rotting tables. There were no other doors and I hadn't remembered seeing another entrance when we'd entered. With a sigh of resignation, I pointed the light back down the hallway, spotting nothing around the corner. \"We have to find Jake.\" \n \"What about Steve and Cindy?\" \n \"Maybe they went after Jake and we missed'em...\" I was rubbing the stubble on my chin, sweat pouring down my neck when I remembered Cindy's words. \"The sewers. We could find them and then get out through the sewers.\" \n \"What? Why don't we find an *actual* door or get out through a window?\" \n \"I think all the windows are up on the higher floors, and none of these rooms go anywhere. We'd have to go down that hallway anyways to keep searching.\" \n \"I guess...\" Lucy followed me down the hallway, both of us huddled close together. As we followed our original flight after Jake, we approached the lit up hallway, the light blinking out as we rounded the corner. Upon turning, we both froze, my flashlight beam illuminating Steven's torso moments before he was dragged down the stairs screaming, vanishing in the dark. \n -- -"], "outline": ["Your friends dare you to stay one night in the abandoned hospital .

{"story": ["Something kept poking at Palpatine's mind; something was calling to him. It had kept him up for days at a time, and was slowly starting to interfere with his grand plans concerning Order 66. Something had altered the balance of the Force, something that ascended the matters of Sith and Jedi. \n \"Master, the Kaminoans have told us that the inhibitor chips in the Clones are ready to be activated at will.\" said the voice of apprentice Darth Vader. \"Master? Something disturbs you, what is it?\" \n \"A disturbance in the Force, Anakin. Someone has achieved a promising sign of power. A rival to your power.\" responded Palpatine, who was now formulating a plan to test his dark apprentice even further. \n \"Who is it my Lord? Master Yoda? Obi-Wan?\" the voice of Anakin was filling with hate and anger, he could not comprehend that someone was able to compete with his level of power. Nor did he want to accept it. \n \"Yes, let the hate flow through you, Anakin.\" said Palpatine as he cynically started cackling. \"A Jedi Knight who has left the order; he has achieved a balance of both light and dark within himself. Such power, such control has never been seen before. It must be stopped.\" \n \"Of course my Lord, I shall leave immediately. Where is this Jedi?\" \n \"No, Lord Vader. You shall not leave today.\" said Palpatine, purposefully adding a pause to rile up the negative feelings in his apprentice. \"The 501st is slated to storm the Jedi Temple, they will dispose of this self proclaimed Grey Jedi.\" \n \"My Lord, this is outrageous. The clones are tasked with something that you even admit is a rival to **my power**? I could destroy the entire temple by myself! You can not hold me back!\" \n \"Excellent, Anakin, excellent! The hate flows through you, I feel it. You are ready; join the 501st tomorrow and kill this grey Jedi, kill all the Jedi you encounter on your way to him as well.\" with his plan to rile up Darth Vader complete, Palpatine threw his head back into a wicked crackle and proceeded to stare out his window upon the city of Coruscant.", "-- \n & nbsp; \n Darth Vader and the 501st stormed the Jedi Temple, shooting and slicing down all who crossed their path. Lord Vader let his hatred flow through his body and grow with each kill he gained; he was determined to silence any and all competition to his spot as apprentice to Palpatine. \n \"Break formation and catch any stragglers. Go.\" the command was simple, yet Vader still thought he placed too much trust in the clones for such a big task. \"I will find you Grey Jedi, show yourself.\" shouting, and sprinting around the temple, Vader continued to slay Jedi until he could focus on his target. \n \"Lord Vader, or should I say Anakin Skywalker, traitor to the galaxy?\" said a voice from behind the Jedi Library. \"I am the Grey Jedi you search for. I am Master Ram Dar.\"", "Vader was not expecting a young man, no older than twenty, brandishing a newly forged yellow Lightsaber in a defensive position. \"You die today, Ram Dar. The Sith show no mercy to any type of Jedi.\" \n \" So be it. Your angry flows through you, as does mine, but you can not control it; you have let your anger blind you, I have let mine guide me.", "Vader had enough of the philosphical talk and force sprinted towards Ram Dar at an incredible speed pounding his lightsaber across his multiple times: to Vader's surprise, Ram Dar was able to keep up to pace with the strikes. Pouncing overhead with a force charged front flip, Ram Dar used the force to push Vader on the ground. Vader leapt back up and continued with the offensive blows while Ram Dar used a defensive style. Vader grew quickly tired of this and started pouring his anger into his blows, his eyes turning into a familiar orange, a sign of a Sith. Ram Dar noting the charge of negative energy switched to an offensive fighting style to combat the power shift, but Ram Dar's offensive blows could not match those of Vader. \n \"You tap into the Dark Side for power, very clever. Yet you use the Light Side to remain in your oh so elegant form. How proper of you.\" mocked Vader \"But let's end this-\" interrupted by a force choke being performed by Ram Dar, Vader found himself being choked significantly, the air escaping his lungs and his breath rapidly fainting. \n \"Yes, Vader, let us end this.\" said Ram Dar as he tightened his grip, now walking himself and Vader to a nearby wall to finish the act. As Vader was pressed against the wall an explosion could be heard in the distance, knowing this was the clones all Vader had to do was break free of this grip and stall him long enough for a much, much closer explosion. Closing his eyes Vader thought of his true love, Padme, and focused the force flowing through his body to push Ram Dar off of him, screaming with his might as he breathed again. Pulling Ram Dar with the force towards the same wall, Vader told the clones to fire an explosive weapon towards the wall. For once, Vader put genuine trust in the clones and he was satisfied when the explosion crippled Ram Dar to his knees. \n \"I will admit you were a challenge, but you were never a real threat to me.\" said Vader as he beheaded the Grey Jedi. Tired and weakened from a fight that should've ended faster, Vader prepared to travel to Mustafar to meet his Master in person. \n"], "outline": ["Shortly before Order 66 a Jedi knight achieves true balance between the light and the dark side .

{"story": ["\"Dr. Edmunds, something interesting came up on the latest screen,\" stated Johannes, the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism. \n \"This better be good. My grant proposal is due Friday,\" stated Edmunds, finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes. He quickly glanced at the ground, concealing his surprise. Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual. His face started to burn. Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund's office without scheduling an appointment. Luckily, Johannes' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention. She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray, hair greasy and biosafety suit wrinkled. He must have been working double shifts. \n \"I-If this is what I think it is, you'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money,\" Johannes replied. \"I repeated this experiment three times, always in triplicates. Data is statistically significant at a *p* of 0.0001. In other words, there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation, and --\" \n \"Let me see,\" she interrupted. Johannes passed her the sheets of data. Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward, brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers. \n Sample 1215: at long last, a positive hit.", "A rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund's face, then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin. Eyes shining, she said, \"We spent five years at the edge of this colony, hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth....\" here, a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart. She coughed violently, spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth. Pulling away, spots of blood were seen. She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief. There weren't many unstained areas left on the fabric. The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest.", "Johannes offered her water, which she gratefully sipped. After a pause, she continued. \"We took a risk being here. They said we couldn't find anything by the mines. But that ended up being our advantage. What was Sample 1215?\"", "Johannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement. \"Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines. There is life down there, likely bacterial in origin, and it is producing this compound in great quantities. Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth, though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins,\" he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth. \"When given to cancer cells *in vitro*, it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells. In the animal model, this compound appears to stop angiogenesis. In other words, in addition to its cancer-specific cytotoxicity, it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor.\"", "Edmunds slowly stood, smile unwavering. \"You have made a remarkable discovery, Johannes. You will finally be able to graduate with your Ph.D., with nothing less than the highest honors.\" \n \"Thank you, Dr. Edmunds. Without your direction, this wouldn't have been possible,\" Johannes replied, bowing his head. A shadow crept over his face. There was a hesitating silence before he continued. \"I... I knew about your condition all along. The cancer you tried to keep secret. The same cancer afflicting most of the population on Earth. The way you are now....There isn't much time.\" \n Edmunds nodded slowly in agreement. It was foolish of her to think the others wouldn't have noticed by now. \n \"I can give you the first treatment,\" Johannes said, looking up to meet Edmunds' eyes. \"It might give you more time. Enough to see that we take it home over the years.\"", "Her eyes looked past Johannes towards the window, beyond the red terrain and into the sky. \"Yes, I would like that very much. But that can't be the focus now. I didn't tell anyone this, but there's only going to be one more trip from the Colony to go home. Back on Earth, people have given up so much hope that they don't want to allocate anymore resources to us. The grant I have been writing was for a separate project that can be done on Earth.\" \n \"What?!\" Johannes blurted loudly. \"There is only one chance to take home a cure we only discovered this month? For all of the people affected on Earth? How can we manage that?\"", "Edmunds sighed. The weariness she felt was not only physical. \"What we will do is find the organism producing Compound 1215, and find out the conditions it best grows in. Then, we will see if we can mimic those conditions on Earth. If we can grow the bacteria on Earth, we can produce the cure there. I want this done in six months. That is when you all will be scheduled to leave.\" \n \"Just wait a second -- what do you mean,'you all'? Aren't you going also?\" Johannes said. He pulled a chair from the desk. His head was spinning.", "Edmunds smiled sadly. \"When I came here, I never expected I would actually return. There's nothing left for me on Earth.\" Her gaze drifted to a framed picture on her desk, of a smiling family. Edmunds was once a young wife, with a husband and three children. \"I'll carry on work here for as long as I can, and relay information to you from here. It was my hope that *you* would personally take over my work.

{"story": ["I like James, he's a good friend.", "I remember the first time I met him. We were both at the same teen camp that happens every summer and winter out in Appalachian mountains. He was playing offence, and I was playing defence. A fight broke out between both of our teams, and before anyone knew what had really happened, everyone and anyone throwing punches. And that was the first time I remember seeing him, and unconventionally meeting him. My fist flying into his face.", "Surprisingly though, by the end of the camp we had become best mates. What started out as bitter rivalry after that brawl slowly became a friendly rivalry and then evolved into friendship. In the next few months after camp we ended up hanging out a lot with one another, as my Mum moved to the same town as him. Me and my Mum ended up moving for a bunch of reasons, mainly though'cause she couldn't find work in the other town we were living in. That and there were concerns that a serial killer was loose in the region, preying on mainly teenage boys from high schools. My mum, having suffered sexual abuse at the hands of my father, could never stand the thought of that every possibly happening to me; so therefore that was the other part of the reason that we had left the last three towns that had young guys disappear in.", "Since we ended up in the same high school, it allowed me and James to catch up whenever we wanted. I still remember the time when we threw fireworks under Principal Miller's car, or the time when we snuck into the school pool in the middle of the night with some babes. I remember when we stayed up one night just star gazing, next to a shed we had found in the forest, talking about anything and everything. James would often talk about whatever girl he liked at the moment, or the last girl he had sex with, while I sometimes asked him questions like anal sex and blowjobs feels like.", "I still also can remember the first time that I told him that I liked him. He laughed me off, told me that he liked me too and tried to changed subject. \n I just stood there. \n Unamused.", "Perplexed by my silence, he turned around to see me standing there. The look on my face. My sincereness of what I had said. \n And then it dawned on him what I said, or more specifically, what I had meant. \n Lost for words, he quickly excused himself and drove away; leaving me just standing there. \n Hurt. \n Alone. \n Vulnerable. \n I had opened up to him and he hadn't even replied. He just drove away. \n The next few weeks at school were like torture. \n He wouldn't look at me. \n He wouldn't talk to me. \n He wouldn't respond to any of my texts or phone calls. \n And so I planned a way I could make it up to him. Make it up for both of us. \n About a week later I was ready.", "Not wanting to waste any time, I slipped a letter into his locker that morning detailing that I was sorry for what I said and how I just wanted us to be friends again. Furthermore, I also mentioned that I wanted to make it up to him, and therefore that I had a surprise I wanted to give him as a sign of my goodwill in this situation. At the bottom of the letter I had written the where and when The secret shed in the forest - 8pm.", "He must have read the letter pretty soon after I had slipped it in, as less than an hour later I received a text from him simply stating ***Kk, will be there. Got something at 9 I have to be back for though. ***", "The day passed excruciatingly slowly. Each tick of the clock in class seemed to slow down purposefully, as if to delay our joyous reunion. However, eventually the moment finally came. He arrived at the shed, where I was waiting; the shed that we had never told any of our friends or family about. I welcomed him, apologised, and gave him a beer from pack that I had brought. I told him that I wanted us to relax before I showed him his surprise, and so we sat down for a good 15 minutes while he had a few beers and I just asked questions about his classes.", "About 10 minutes later, he was gone. My customized beers had done their job. Moving quickly, I carefully dragged him inside the shed and tied him many times to the chair that I had brought. Once securing him, I proceeded to duct tape his hands, mouth and even feet. There would be no escape for him until he fully realised, how much I needed him. And how much he secretly needed me, even though he wasn't aware of it. I needed the time to for him to realise this as well, so I took his car keys and drove his car into one of the rivers going through the forest.", "Within the next hour, he woke up. At first he seemed confused. He was trying to shout through the duct tape and break out of chair and ropes. I told him that I was helping him. I told him that I was helping him realise how much he needed me. \n And how much I needed him. \n But he didn't listen. \n Not at first. \n But as the several days between now and then slowly passed by, he began to understand.", "I am with him now, as I write this to all of you. You really should be here too, to be able to see the way that the lovingly way that he looks at me know. To be able to understand all the beautiful ways that we pleasure one another. The kind words he whispers into my ears, even though he has duct tape over his mouth.

Through them I spent months working on my master plan. A Tournament. An inter-kingdom, prestigious tournament. Bags of gold and hands of fair maidens for the winners. It took several years to build up, but when it finally gained the size and recognition I wanted - it was glorious. Every single noble family for hundreds of miles attended. The festivities went on for a solid week. Every single king and his entourage was there. I actually started to take a lot of pride and interest in this little project - it was a fun diversion. \n Like building a sand castle before you stomp on it.", "And stomp I did. At the ten-year celebration. The final night ’ s awards ceremony. I was actually nervous, leading up to it. And then - oh, the glory. I timed my approach to appear over the horizon right at sunset, flying directly out of the sun. My first breath lit the treetops and flags - a precision shot. My second lit a ring of fire around the entire grounds - a circumference of miles. Of course, I left a little room to escape - no point in a grand showing if nobody ’ s around to tell the tale afterwards. In face, I specifically singled out every bard, storyteller, and entertainer so that they remained as undamaged as I could manage. \n Oh, how they screamed. For the first time in so many years, I had their undivided attention.", "Of course they didn ’ t fight me there. Airborne, a surprise attack, their tournament grounds, tents, and buildings burning around them? They ran, and died. I boiled them alive in their armor. I bit them in half. I festooned horse entrails from the flagpoles. I even seized an honest-to-god princess to take back with me, right out of her father ’ s protective arms.", "And then I waited. With the hoard gleaming, the princess caged, their lands burning and desecrated, I waited. \n And do you know what they did? \n NOTHING. THAT IS WHAT THEY DID. \n For a solid month. Not one knight. Not one attack. Not even a strongly-worded note. \n I finally couldn ’ t stand it any longer, and one night, let the princess out of the cage to talk. \n Why? I demanded.", "She explained that dragon-slaying, which was an erroneous term as nobody had ever actually *slain* me was outdated. The kingdoms had learned to account for the loss of their cattle and fields occasionally and factored that into their economic plans. The extreme patriarchy decided that knights were far less expendable than maidens, and since I only took unmarried virgins ( STANDARDS ), the easiest way to avoid losing daughters was to marry them off as fast as possible.", "They actually liked having me around! I drove off other dragons and even kept large predators out of my range. It was something of an honor to have your possessions looted for my hoard; some noble families kept track of how often I “ visited ” them and used it at a status symbol! One of the kingdoms had declared my cavern and hoard a “ historical treasure ”.", "They felt I did them a favor by eliminating knights too stupid or short-sighted to try to fight me. I was an asset to the kingdoms. I was an icon. I was practically a god. \n How? I asked her. I eat you. I kill your children. I kidnap your sisters and daughters. I burned you!", "But you ’ re a good person, she said sincerely. You spare the poor and hungry. You kill the rich and mean. You never unfairly burden anyone. The tournament - they'd figured out I hosted it each year - it was so unexpected. She was confused, and thought maybe I wasn't feeling well or they'd upset me somehow, and she was sure her father was confused, but nobody was going to come rescue her because she was sure that I was just going to let her go.", "I didn ’ t.

But it got me thinking - and I finally hit on my mistake. \n *That fucking farmer*.", "So I think I ’ ve decided it ’ s time to move on.

But this... this was an entire world of neurological pathways being activated. This led to that, that led to the other -- every memory of Isaiah pushed into one long moment of beautiful, beautiful pain. \n Isaiah! \n He saw him everywhere, he dreamed of him, was haunted by him. \n He loved him, so, so much. \n He didn't even know him!", "Isaiah. The creator of the memory couldn't live loving Isaiah in this painful way, knowing he was gone.

He walked to the bathroom, wash the tears off his face. A glance in the mirror and he saw someone new, just briefly. She wasn't beautiful, the way Isaiah was, but that angel reflected in her eyes and became her. The memory holder. \n He had to find her. He had to give it back. He didn't want this memory anymore. \n - \n \"I don't know an Isaiah,\" she said plainly. Of course she didn't. \n \"You gave away your memory of him, please, take it back. I don't want it.

It sat in the middle of a dark mahogany table, and condensation formed on its silver side as the clock ticked inexorably forward. One woman in the audience held a white handkerchief to her mouth, as if to hide the salivation that gathered there. The smell filling the dank courtroom was almost indescribable. Each member of the jury could pinpoint a different scent.", "The man with the dark skin, orange turban and fearsome set of mustachios smelled ginger, vanilla, brown sugar and cardamon, while the woman on his left with the bulging signs of an advanced pregnancy, leaned forwards and sniffed eagerly at the sour pomegranate and blood orange smell. The foreman of the jury, with his fisherman's sweater and white beard, could not escape the familiar scent of garlic, white wine and -- oddly enough, tarragon. The housewife would have sworn the smell was bread rising, mixed with fresh marmalade, while the man with nervous hands and greasy hair could have told you it was pickle relish and fresh tomatoes, so ripe the juice would drip down your hands. They all leant forwards against the barrier, waiting for the judge to come in and the cloche to be lifted so one of them could be proven right. More importantly, so the rest of them could be proven wrong.", "It was universally agreed by almost every food professor, that the dish itself was sacrilegious. It broke every rule in the book. An abomination. *It should not be able to smell like that. * Simply false advertising. The chef, Josip, in shackles, sat in the prisoner's bench, looking miserably at his feet. If you asked him -- and no one did -- he could only smell burning. He'd smelled burning for sixteen years, after his wife had died in a mysterious blaze which ate up his life's work in recipes.", "The judge entered and the court rose to their feet. Sniffing the air, the judge settled into his seat and drew his horsehair wig about him. Lord Carlisle smelled rich plum jam and hot milk, reminiscent of the time he'd spent as a troublesome prankster in a boarding school in the north of England. The youngest judge on the bench, Josip's lawyer had asked for him specifically, most likely for his forgiving nature. His Lordship thought boys would be boys, after all. Lord Carlisle shuddered, ill at ease with the sudden memory. Some pranks had gone a little too far. \n \"Let me taste the food,\" Lord Carlisle said. False advertising be damned, he could not help it. The smell was intoxicating, it begged to be tasted. Perhaps if he tasted it, he could wash the memory away as easily as he had washed away the soot from his hands that awful night -- no. He would not think of that now.", "Josip got to his feet and watched as the cloche was brought to his Lordship's bench. The usher lifted it, the court watched with bated breath. \n \"A soup?\" Lord Carlisle cried. \"You mean to tell me, you have made a soup!\"", "The court reporters began scribbling furiously as his Lordship, former troubled youth, owner of a buried past, tasted the soup.

He intended to stop, but the urge was too great. Saliva filled his mouth and he leant closer and closer to the plate until he licked at the dregs of it.

Lord Carlisle coughed. \"This is awful!\" He said. \"Water, please!\" \n He scrambled for the glass on his desk and chocked, gulping it down. \"It tastes like burning!\"", "From the prisoner's bench, Josip smiled.

{"story": ["BLACK SEA MONARCHY THREATENED BY 3500 YEAR OLD RUINS \n *Joachim Yanipatris*", "The ruins of the ancient city of Gannunatui, discovered in Seszirya by an international archaeological expedition in early 2011 were ordered to be demolished today by King Helkurij Ziryokov. This follows similar demolitions that have taken place in the tiny Black Sea nation since 2012.", "Several petitions have been sent by eminent historians across the world to preserve these ruins, which date back to the 15th century BC and may yield knowledge about the development of urban communities in the region. According to Dr. Taher al-Sina from the University of Cairo, Gannunatui, which means'City of the Exalted', represents the only artifact of the First Nimmuki Kingdom, established by refugees fleeing Babylon from the Kassite invasions of the 15th century BC. The Nimmuki controlled a substantial part of the western Caucasus for the next three centuries before disappearing during the'Sea People' invasions that also saw the end of their Hittite allies in Anatolia.", "They re-appeared in the 6th century BC as one of the ‘ Traitor Tribes ’ who defected to the Persian Orontids and helped destroy the fledging Urartu Empire. They promptly disappeared again only to sporadically re-emerge in turbulent periods of the region, usually termed as ‘ betrayers ’ or ‘ false-voiced ’. Mithridates VI of Pontus called them ‘ seeds of wickedness ’ after their delaying action led to the slaughter of his army by Pompey ’ s Roman forces. They were part of Andronikos Doukas ’ advisors whose betrayal in the Battle of Manzikert led to a catastrophic Byzantine defeat from which the Empire never recovered. Tamerlane employed them as mercenaries during his invasion of Georgia and they are the ‘ Nimkakhe ’ villains of the Georgian epic-poem *Dasha Karakussal*. They vanished during the purges of Alexios III of Trebizond and are not mentioned again in any regional records.", "The current Sesso-Circassian majority is divided into several clans who claim descent from Genoan and Venetian mercenaries employed by the Black Sea Greeks to fight against the Ottomans in the 15th century. The Ziryokov Clan has been pre-eminent among them since 1934 when they broke away from the other clans and signed their territory over to the Soviets. Under terms of this agreement, the Soviets *dispersed* the leaders of rival clans across Siberia. The Ziryokov-Soviet relationship soured in 1987 after Ioannes Ziryokov declared Sesziryan independence. Ioannes ’ nation endured for an entire month against brutal Soviet reprisals. His appeals for aid and foreign intervention failed to get through the Soviet blockade and his doomed rebellion was subsequently never reported by the international press.", "After the Soviet collapse, Seszirya became an independent monarchy under King David Ziryokov. A brief affair with American style democracy was attempted in the late nineties but failed after the attempted assassination of Prince Helkurij in 1998.", "Corruption is rampant in Seszirya and poverty remains a widespread issue. Electricity is only available in the capital of Ganade and the port of Nakapetra. Although investments in infrastructure have increased substantially in recent years, Seszirya remains a predominantly agricultural country. Reforms initiated by King Helkurij in 2010 have shown promise of increasing revenue.", "In 2005, the popular local singer Atyana Suranova accused the Ziryakovs of ‘ Nimya blood ’, drawing traces between them and the ‘ Traitor Tribes ’. King Sokij in turn accused her of being in the pay of Turkey and Georgia, and of attempting to weaken the Sesziri nation. Suranova was executed and rumors about Ziryokov heritage were repressed.", "The discovery of Gannunatui led to a renewal in these rumors. The Mekossoku Democratic Block, formed after Helkurij ’ s reforms, promised to uncover the truth during the terminated elections last November. It is widely believed that Helkurij ’ s hold over Nakapetra is shaky while the capital of Ganade is beset by violent protests demanding evidence of his true bloodline. A military high command overhaul early this year also suggests that there may be dissension in the ranks. Observers in Ankara and Tbilisi believe that Ziryokov is crucial for stability in Seszirya and that his ouster could result in collapse. Their aid continues to prop up the current regime.", "Helkurij ’ s demolition of Gannunatui are said to be an attempt to prove his credentials and silence all alleged links with the hated Nimya.

After requesting a beer for himself from the serving girl, he turned to them, “ You got yourselves a piece of paper too? You been hired by the old man? ” he asked, holding his parchment up for them to see.", "The mage turned, smiled and opened his mouth to speak, but the ranger spoke first, “ Might be we are. Who ’ re you? And which old man do you speak of? ” he asked, ignoring the mage to peer suspiciously at Duncan. \n “ Duncan. I ’ m Duncan. Boris hired me. The hammer that the goblins stole from the blacksmith? Says the hammer was passed on through the blacksmith ’ s family from father to son, the hammer of some long dead king that were overthrown. ” The serving girl brought his drink, and he took a long drink, asking “ How are you both called? ”", "The mage spoke first now, “ I ’ m Victor. My cautious friend here is Avery, and we have both been tasked by Boris to retrieve the very same hammer you spoke of. Yet another of our party is missing. ”", "As the mage finished speaking, a man stumbled into the inn, his garb black and tight, black hair about his shoulders. “ I ’ m here! ” he said, out of breath, hands at his knees, “ Don ’ t… don ’ t worry. I ’ m here, ” he panted, taking a seat at the table after regaining some small measure of composure. His eyes were bloodshot, and his hands went to his head the moment he took his seat. He was hung over. “ I ’ m Gerald. Boris hired you lot too, right? ” \n “ Yeah, he did, ” Duncan confirmed, introducing the other men in turn, “ We ’ re all prepared, yeah? ” he looked around the group, “ Once we ’ ve met we ’ re to start down the Goblin Trail, the paper says. We can plot while we travel, there ’ s no reason to stay here, ” he said, to no disagreement.

The inn was at the edge of the town, a long dirt path leading away from the gate into the distance towards Brickenville.

The hammer was rumored to have been taken there. \n “ Me granddad, though, ” Gerald was saying, “ The best damn thief that ever lived, that he was. King Lester called on him plenty o ’ times, things lost and needing stealing, and I taken up the trade when me father left and bedded some princess… ” \n “ You ’ d think from such a gifted line of men, you ought to have the sense to lie with more grace, ” the ranger said, his amused tone laced with irritation. \n “ I ’ m not tellin ’ no tales! ” Gerald said, hurt, “ It ’ s true!

Avery unslung his bow and knocked an arrow, ready to draw, while Duncan drew his sword, his shield held up. A high voice said, “ Go! Idiot! Go! They stopped! ” and a small green figure tumbled out of the bushes followed by four other goblins, each held a dagger or a short sword and all wore tattered leather. They screamed and charged, two rushing at Duncan, two at Victor, and another at Gerald.", "Duncan swung his sword at one goblin, his sword flying wildly over the goblin ’ s head as the goblin nicked him in the leg with his dagger, dropping his shield to barely block the other goblin ’ s thrust. He turned and swung again at the first one, the tip of his sword catching the goblin ’ s finger as it tried to avoid the cut, and it screamed and dropped its dagger. He swung his shield around and caught the side of the goblin ’ s head, and it fell limp to the ground. He turned his attention to the second one, just as it bit him on the leg, thrusting its sword at his other leg.", "He hollered out and moved his other leg to avoid the thrust, and put his boot against the goblin ’ s face as it reared back to take another bite at him. The goblin staggered back, dazed, and Duncan swung his sword, his grip on his own blade loose and watched as the sword flew from his hand, the tip of his sword spearing the goblin between the eyes. He rushed towards the goblin to wrench the sword out of the little green skull to cover up his shameful mistake, and turned to see that his allies fared little better.", "Victor was fleeing in large circles, wand in hand, two scorched marks upon the earth, an arrow lodged in his arm though no goblin carried a bow. Two unburnt goblins chased him with daggers, cackling, while the ranger stood aside with his bow, loosing arrows at the goblins. An arrow landed in the dirt a foot from a goblin, one landed just shy of Victor ’ s heel, another flew between the legs of another goblin, and another just past Duncan ’ s own head. \n “ I missed both spells! I have no more! ” the mage yelled at Duncan, thwacking at the goblins with his wand when they got close as they were chasing him. One of the goblins had a hand over one eye, stumbling as he and his companion chased Victor. \n “ They won ’ t… stop… moving… ” Avery said, red faced and flustered, and turned his attention instead to the rogue who was grappling with his own goblin in the dirt. \n “ Me daggers! He took me daggers! ” Gerald yelled, struggling to keep the blades away from him, the goblin cackling madly.

{"story": ["It is now 2095 by the Earth calendar, my grandfather was alive and only 21 almost 22 when the Galactic Empire came in contact with Earth. This what the story he told me:", "When I was 21, just a few weeks shy of 22, the Empire had discovered Earth. This caused quite the stir as, we didn't know there was other life beyond our own planet or not. Since humans were the dominate species of earth, we weren't treated as \"harsh\" as some of the other planets in the Galactic Empire. Because of this contact, technology of Earth started to grow exponentially and allowed us to explore the Milky Way which is only 4000 light years from the galaxy that the Empire came from. With the hyper drive technology that the Empire had in on board the Executor, the personal Super Star destroyer of Lord Vader, it allowed us to commence galactic trade with the Empire. But then everything started to change.", "After a few years, I just had my old student loan debts forgiven and I had just graduated the new Imperial Naval Officer school on Earth so I was about 25 or 26 at the time, I noticed that a few of my friends from my hometown had gone missing. I questioned my parent's about their disappearance and they told me that my friends had decided to join the rebels on the far side of our own galaxy to fight the so called \"oppression\" of the Empire. I could not believe what I had heard. Friends, I had since I was a child long before the Empire came in contact with Earth, had decided to side with the rebels. I no longer could call them my friends. I went before Lord Vader and asked his permission to track and hunt down the rebels as an off the record, that I once called my friends. He looked down at me, as I was on my knee, and he said \"That I may track them down and kill them, then I will start my new training.\" For he saw something in me that he did not notice before.", "I then went to my own personal ship, which was given to me by the Empire for graduating in the top 10 of my class and in the record time that I had done so. The ship was named the Shi no Megami, a name I had selected from the Japanese I had learned while in my spare time, it meant Death Goddess. A goddess of death she was. She was outfitted with latest small craft hyper drive system that allowed for travel across the Milky way in a single week, four gun turrets all operable from the cockpit or by a person in the turrets, three missile bays to carry nuclear arms, 2 new generation heavy defense guns on each side only operable from the cockpit, and cloaking. When I got in the cockpit I noticed an old friend, from my time in the Naval Officer school, and lover sitting in the co-pilot seat, Megana Tami. I didn't even try and argue with the woman, she was as stubborn as I was. She only asked me what I was planning on doing as we were starting to do all the checks before leaving the Executors hangar. When I told her, all she could say was \"Oh. Well, good thing I'm still coming with. Who else would make sure you eat and keep your bed warm for you?\" I couldn't tell if she was serious or joking about that last part, but I didn't care. \n I replied with \"Do you have permission to go on leave?\" \n \"Yes, I do. Lord Vader asked me personally to help you and I brought a fire team with me. From a new program between the Earth and the Empire to help create better storm troopers. You remember the video game series Halo and the backstory behind their spartan programs?\" said Tami. \n \"Yeah, I do. Which version of the spartan program are we talking though? 2, 3, or 4?\" \n \"Why else but 4. The cheapest and best way to make a super soldier, but still make sure they have humanity left in them.\" \n \"So, we have a fire team for pseudo-Spartans on board. Three nukes, and a ship that was outfitted with the best tech that the Empire could make that was given to me as a graduation prize for being in the top 10. This will be a fun journey.\" We had just finished the final piece of the check, and had gotten permission to leave the Executor then we hit light speed to the last known location of a rebel outpost in the Milky Way. It took us about a week to get there and in that time I gotten to know the Storm Spartans, as I have taken to calling them and they seem to like the name as well. Their leader, was named Jackson Cameron, a black man who originally stood probably at 6 feet 4 inches, but now stood closer to 6 feet 9 inches thanks in part of the Spartan 4 like program he went through. Their second in command was someone I knew quite well and didn't know he had joined the Imperial army and went through the program, my cousin, Will. He originally was 6 feet 8 inches, now he stood at a height of 7 feet. Then there was Yamamoto, a Japanese fellow who probably stood at 5 feet 9 inches, is now 6 feet 2 inches. He doesn't say too much, but he and I can carry a conversation in Japanese. Then the medic and sniper of the team, a member of the Galactic Empire since her birth, Jun Katren. She might have stood at 4 feet 10 inches before the Spartan 4esque program, but now she stood at my height of 6 feet. The biggest leap of all of them from what I gather, because her nickname is Runt.", "When we finally get our destination, the edge of the system where the outpost is, we start a scan to see if we can pick up any thing. Then we decide to head to the only planet in the system that we know had to have the outpost on it, Mandas 4. A planet that is in habitable zone for system. When we arrive we find that the rebels were on the planet but not for sometime. But we were able to find a record of where they might be heading. So we started our great chase across the galaxy hoping to nail my one time called friends. It took us 5 Earth months to find them, and the rebel base in the Milky Way.", "The rebels were smart, they decided to set up their base in an asteroid field. I slowly navigated the asteroid field, and once able I put the Megami just outside of their sensor range and in a safe zone where no asteroids where noted to go into, even with our cloak it felt better to not run the risk of being detected. It took us four weeks to discover this zone. Between the four Spartans, Megana, and I we were able to finally able to find the best place to sit and watch the base for a while longer, and to wait for the opportune time to strike. The chance came when Megana and I were in bed, my cousin came and told me that he had found a perfect moment to strike. I told \"Okay, get everyone to the hologram projector.\"", "When everyone was assembled, Will turned on the projector and showed us what he had found. \"A window, of only 3 minutes. This is how long their sensors are down for hourly repairs. We can use those three minutes, slip in and start destroying this base and *you*,\" pointing a finger at me \"can find your old'friends' and kill them.\" \n \"Okay this is good. Once we are finished with killing all the personnel in the base, we can fire one of the three nukes we have at the base and thoroughly destroy it. Sound like a plan to everyone?\"", "They all agreed. And at the next time the sensors went down, we slipped in. We able to slip in and start reeking havoc. I quickly found my old \"friends\" and then they tried to talk to me about why the joined the rebellion. I wouldn't have any of it, I quickly killed them all. Once finished we launched a nuke into the base. We went back to Earth, and found Lord Vader was still there in the Executor. When I reported back in, he asked me how it felt to kill my friends. I replied that I felt anger at them and at myself, because I had a fear that I would lose other because of what I had done. He turned around and said, then my training has just begun. What he meant by that was, I was to be trained as a force wielder. Trained by him, so that I could better serve the Empire and the Emperor. He used my fear of losing Megana against me, the women I had grown to love when I had gone off and done what I did. After my training was complete, Vader left the system leaving behind me and several star destroyers.", "Not long after I learned that the Emperor was killed by Vader and Vader's son Luke Skywalker. I being in charge of the Milky Way galaxy while Vader was away, sent an envoy to the victorious rebels and told them I would surrender peacefully if I was allowed to keep my station at the Milky Way until things could get settled and a new republic would be built. They graciously allowed me to do so, and as soon as the New Republic was up and running I was asked to be the senator for the Earth. I graciously declined saying that a different person should be the senator, not someone who was an old Imperial Naval Officer. Your grandmother, Megana, and I, after the Earth had joined the New Republic, soon left Earth to find some distant planet to settle on and start our own family. What felt not too long after all that, you our eldest grandchild, came into our lives. I held onto the Shi no Megami, and maintained her until I gave her to your father, who will give it to you.", "That is the story that my grandfather had told me almost every time I saw him. I was captivated by it, even when I grew older. I still have the Megami, I got it when my father passed unexpectedly from a problem that no one knew of until it was too late. I have updated her, and made sure she was keeping up with the times. She's still a good ship, even keeps up with my forced enhanced reflexes.

His morbid curiosity had left him suddenly, and in its place he felt a faint sort of nausea. Aaron Powlett, he knew, would not stop the attempts on his life unless things changed. And while Newell had a fine nose, he considered an eventual failure on his part inevitable; detecting poison in tea by its scent alone was no accurate science, and he was loathe to test each sip and bite on one of his laboratory rats.", "If he had any interest in regaining his living standards, he had no choice but to talk to Powlett. The conversation would definitely be a disastrous mess of unease and lacking direction, but with luck, Powlett would agree to stop. He shrugged on his coat with determination.", "On the way out, he found a bouquet of flowers in the hall, bearing a blank card. Newell did not even consider that they might be non-poisonous, and jotted down a quick warning on the card - he didn't fancy his maid being killed by them. With a promise to himself to burn the bouquet at his return, he made his way towards the Powlett residence.", "It was not a long walk, not long enough to develop regrets anyway. After a knock and a short wait, he was admitted by the valet who looked at him with wide eyes. As they waited in the lounge for the man of the house, the valet gave a quiet cough. \n \"I was not expecting to see you again, Mr. Roan,\" he said. \n Newell didn't mind the breach of etiquette and responded in a tone belying his nervousness: \n \" I had not planned on it either, but circumstances- ” He stopped speaking the moment ‘ circumstances ’ entered the room. Aaron Powlett, dressed in a smart suit, had halted in his way just shortly after stepping through the door frame. He was obviously investing a lot of care into a neutral expression, but the strained muscles of his jaw as well as his rigid posture made his fear quite clear, at least to those who knew him as well as Newell. \n “ Leave us, ” he told the Valet, for all the world looking like he wanted to accompany him. The servant hurried off and a heavy silence settled.", "Aaron opened his mouth as if to speak, but ended up biting his lower lip instead. His gaze kept flickering towards the door.

His brow was wrinkled in confusion, and he was muttering to himself quietly as if deeply in thought. \n Then Newell took a step towards him, and all turned around. \n “ You, ” Aaron suddenly snarled, crowding against him, pushing him back, back against the wall. “ You only have yourself to blame. Had you not bewitched me, I ’ d never have seen fit to send for your death. But you, you have ruined me! ” \n They were breathing hard, and only inches apart. Newell closed his eyes in anticipation of a blow.", "What followed instead was the gentle weight of Aaron crumbling against him. Newell felt arms encircle his neck instead of the choking hands he had expected and the wetness of tears met his cheek. It was utterly surreal, and Newell did not respond, simply let Aaron sob against him in the most undignified way.", "The man was muttering something. It was muffled by fabric and tears, but it sounded important; Aaron appeared to be repeating it over and over again. After some time, Newell carefully pried his former friend ’ s hands off of him. He didn ’ t let them go when pushing Aaron away, and Aaron made no move to resist his grasp. Instead, he finally stopped muttering and looked at Newell with a gaze of some clarity, if bright with tears. \n “ I knew I had lost to your curse, ” he said softly. “ I knew there was no going back, so I attempted to avenge myself. But the devil was always going to win, and you did. Your curse has wrecked me. I surrender. ” \n Newell felt nauseated. He dropped Aaron ’ s hands. \n “ And yet, ” he choked, “ And yet it seems that these mere words have defeated me. ” \n He took a step back and swallowed heavily. \n “ If you consider me a devil, consider yourself freed of me. Please, refrain from any future attempts at revenge.

{"story": ["The siren, a grim reminder that the annual purge is happening. A time where you can act on every evil impulse for one whole day. How the government allows it still baffles me. Every year the bodies pile up, yet the next day we walk past people smiling. Not knowing if they are in fact the ones that and partied. Yet the purge is the furthest thing from my mind. The thing that happening right in front of me. A person who lives in the same apartment complex, I think his name is David or Dave I'm not entirely sure. Well Dave is currently being used as a chew toy by two people. Jesus I heard of cannibals out on purge but to see it on my front door step. Luckily they aren't armed, me on the other hand. A Beretta, its smart to be armed on this \"special\" day. I raise my gun and point it at these monsters. They don't seem to be aware of my presence just concentrating on poor Dave. \n \"Hey, you better get the hell out of here or else!\"", "They continued to gnaw on the poor bastard. Between this and the noise outside, I feel as if I should just lock myself in my apartment. I can hear gunshots and explosions already, thankfully it sounds far off. I shoot near one of them to try to scare them. That got their attention, yet something about them seems off. I don't know what it's the way they move. That's when I got a look at their face, their faces seemed blank. And they look hurt, they were covered in blood but too much blood to be Dave's. They were slowly making their way towards me, my god they were growling. \n BAM \n Suddenly some bastard just kicks open his door. He's armed with a friggin shotgun. \n \"THIS IS MY RIGHT!!\" he screams as he shoots one of the two cannibals. I could tell he didn't put in hours at the range. He felt flat on his back as soon as he fired his first shot. Got to give it to him as he got one. Shot the poor bastards arm straight off. Yet he doesn't even notice. Both of them jumped on him, guess they had room for desert. I could hear the sound of flesh being bitten off and his horrific screams. I grab all the courage I had and fired on one of the them. Four shots in the back but the bastard didn't even react. He gets up and stares right into my eyes. There's absolutely nothing there, I could sense his blood lust. He charges right at me. \n BANG BANG two in the chest. He's almost at arms length. I close my eyes. BANG. \n BANG", "I don't even want to know what happened. I'm okay since no one pushed me on the ground. I open one eye to see my would be attacker on the ground. The last shot got him right in the head. I still trying to figure out how this guy can be moving so fast after being shot 6 times. It's not humanly possible. The other had his head completely blown off by Shotgun Guy. He's on the ground crying. I keep my gun trained on him. \n \"No sudden moves, are you participating?\" You can't trust people who play this sick game.", "He looks straight at me, no wait he's looking past me. His eyes are widening. I quickly to turn around to see Dave get up. There's no possible way he could. The injuries he have, the loss of blood, he should be dead. That's when I see it he has the same eyes of his killers. I back away slowly as he starts making his way towards me. Damn my stupidity because the I trip on the body I just put down. How stupid that I let this guy be the cause of my death. Now Dave charges at me with the same intent as the other guy. I can't even manage to bring my gun, I'm paralyzed with fear. \n BAM", "it happened so quick, Shotgun guy blasted Dave. Dave was barely standing, BAM. Dave was down, then Shotgun guy set his sights on me. He gave me a look. \n \"Well I'm really in bad shape here. Can you help me? I promise I won't hurt you\"", "I just nodded at him. Don't know why I was helping him. I knew what he was going to do yet I didn't want to be alone right now. With the madness that just went on right now, I needed someone to talk to. I get up and slip my gun into my back. Its crazy with all the noise happening no one came rushing out to see what was going on or even help. You can thank the Purge for that. I carry Shotgun guy to his apartment. I kind of though we should go o my apartment instead since my apartment still has its door intact. Not the best thing to do when everyone is trying to kill you. I lay him on his sofa as carefully as possible. He tells me he has a first aid kid in the bathroom under the sink. I get it for him, apparently he has little medical experience. He begins patching himself up. \n \"So can you tell me what the fuck was that?\" \"I don't know, your guest is as good as mine\" \"Were they eating Matt?\" \"Matt? Was that his name? I thought it was Dave...\" \"No it was Matt. He was going to come with me to... exercise our rights\" \"So you begin by kicking down your own door?\" \"Well I was excited, I didn't expect for two cannibals to treat me like their lunch?:\" Were they really cannibals though? I mean I never saw a person take that many bullets and still move as fast as they can \"", "We heard a scream, it sounded as though it came from above us. A more gunshots coming from somewhere in our building. Then we heard something that sent a shiver down my spine. A kind of scream, no a screech that echoed through the building. \n \"What the hell was that?\" \"I don't know, but I think we should arm ourselves a little bit more\" \"I got this Beretta\" \"I think you should really arm yourself. check the backroom, pick anything you like\"", "I look at him, Shotgun guy seemed to be in bad shape. His breathing seems strained. He looked pale, I knew he got hurt but he didn't seem that bad. I got up and went to see what was in the backroom. It was a cabinet filled with arsenal. I looked at everything. I questioned if I really needed it. I could just lock myself in my apartment till the day ended. But something in my gut told me that this is somehow different. I grabbed the assault rifle and slung it around my back. Two MP5, and a Glock which I'm going to hide. \n \"Hey you done in there?\"", "I step out, he kind of looked stunned when I came out. I don't think he expected me to have gotten so much gear. \n \"Don't forget to put on body armor, all that shits no good if you just going to get shot\" \"Why are you helping me?\" \".....if you didn't get that other guy off me..cough cough..I probably would have been eaten alive like Matt \" \"Thank you..uh\" \"It's Nathan\" \"Nathan, huh. Well you saved my life out there, you didn't need to do all this\" \"I don't know why I did. I think as those monsters were munching on me....I... I was so afraid. *cough cough cough * his cough seems to be getting worse. I thought about what I was going to do tonight. I would have been like those monsters. People dying as they were afraid, seeing their own monster. I don't want to die feeling like a monster\" \"It's okay you're not going to die. We going to wait this out\" \"I don't think that's possible\" he shows me his hands, they were covered in blood. Not from the attack but from the cough. \"One thing I don't get how Matt was able to get up. He was dead, no one\" COUGH COUGH COUGH \"Don't try to speak, I wondered that too to be honest. His eyes were the same as theirs....blank\"", "We both looked at each other for a while, an eternity to be honest. Another screech and another. They seemed to be getting closer and closer. I run outside to see if the coast was clear. \n \"We should move this to my apartment, it has a metal door. It can hold up till the night ends\" SILENCE \"Nathan?\"", "Nathan dropped to the floor and started convulsing. I try to hold him down but he pushed me away. I couldn't understand what was happening. Then he went silent. I call out his name, nothing. That's when I saw his finger twitch. He sat up quick. I call out his name again, but nothing. He was silent, then turned to look at me. That's when I saw his eyes, the same eyes as Matt, the same eyes as those cannibals. I pointed the rifle at him and told him to just stay still. \n SCREEEEEEEEEEECHHHH", "Nathan who I was just talking with a moment ago was trying to kill me. I opened fired at him, but it had the same effect last time. Nathan full of holes yet he didn't care. He just wanted to kill me. That's when I had a flash back of the first time. When I closed my eyes, I shot at the head and the cannibal went down. \n \"I'm sorry Nathan\" BAM. His brain was all over the wall and he was finally down. I couldn't even process the thought of killing my savior before I heard more screams coming from the hall. I looked at Nathan one last time before I head out. I peeked around the corner to find a woman thrown from her apartment. Then some guy with a bloody machete. I was about to shoot this bastard, I don't need this too. He kicked in the door to another apartment. And before I could get a clear shot, out came the resident of that apartment. An old lady who just jumped on him and took a bite out of his neck. The guy started screaming and hacking away at the old lady. I would've felt bad if I didn't know what he was doing. I was caught off guard when four people with the same look at him came. Probably a small gang enjoying their right. They all set their sights on the old lady. They blasted her to little bits, I don't think they realize whats going on. A huge guy with a skull painted on his face kneed down to see how bad his companion is. He quickly got up and shot him.", "That's when I heard more screeching coming from behind me. I saw more of them a whole lot more. They heard the loud noise and decided this is probably where the food is. I decided not to interfere. I went back to the apartment and hid. I had a clear view of the door, and if someone tried to come in... well I do what I have to do. I saw a group of the monsters just run past charging at the skull gang. Shots were fired. I heard screams, screeches mixed together. I slowly move towards the door to see what was going on. I saw that two of them were already victims to those monsters. While the other two were trying to fend them off. They deserve this. \n "], "outline": ["The zombie apocalypse has broken out in the suburbs of New York City .

Bye!\" \n \"Bye!\" \n. \n \"The city wide curfew came into effect one month ago today, and whilst tomorrow marks the 10 year anniversary of the anarchist threats, tonight on Newsnight our show is not about tomorrows anticipated events. Instead, we have a young politician whose party has risen above both Conservative and Labour leaders in most recent polls. The Young Liberals are a party that have sprung up during the increase in fear over the vigilantes return. They vehemently oppose the government imposed city wide curfew, with 27-year-old party leader Marilyn Jeffries saying the curfew should be lifted immediately, as it only protects those who put the city at risk. Calling it a waste of tax payers money, she calls not only for the abolition of the curfew, but a complete overhaul of the current political system. Support for the party has increased in the lead up to next months general election. The Young Liberals Party has managed to gain support from the younger generation, the new voters who until now had seemed mostly apathetic when it came to politics. In the 2015 general election, only 19 % of 16-24 year-olds registered to vote, under half the number of registered young voters in the previous elections, despite the 2014 decision to lower the voting age to 16, with hopes of encouraging young voters. With numbers again expected to drop in these elections, the increase came as a surprise to both our current government and its shadow cabinet. With 87 % of young people already registered to vote next month, it looks like the curfew might be on it's way out. Here to talk with us today is party leader Marilyn Jeffries. Ms Jeffries, thank you for coming in today\" \n \"My pleasure, Jeremy. Thank you for having me on the show, and thanks for quite an introduction.\" \n \"So, Ms Jeffries, your party stands to not only dissolve the curfew, but also to begin an overhaul on the current government practice. Your critics say that the current government saved the country from financial ruin, reducing unemployment and enforcing a drop in crime levels. To be blunt, why fix something that isn't broken?\" \n \"I applaud the government for their financial success, I really do. However, I can't agree that it still isn't a broken system. Yes, they may have solved the problems, but they also caused them. They allowed for banks to destroy the economy, they overlooked flaws in the NHS, in the education systems. They allowed for a system of bribery and favours. The government is supposed to be for the people, not for personal gain. We don't need career politicians or lords with no real idea of hardship. We can't forget that these are the same people who cheated expenses and lied to cover their backs. This government is fake, and allows for greedy individuals to use power for selfish gain, and not for the good of the country. \n\" It might have been accepted before, but we aren't letting it go on. This is a time for change, not a time to cover up the mistakes of the past. We need to start again, moving on from the mistakes of those before us, learning from them, and never going back to where we were 10 years ago. There is a future to fight for, and that's exactly what I intend to do. \"", "**This is a Public Announcement: \"The city wide curfew is now in action. All citizens must now be inside.

I closed my mouth and looked up, wondering what the hell could have caused such a deep noise, when I noticed my chest fluttering, like someone touched a huge tuning fork to it. I couldn't move but people around me scattered, running for cover like an airstrike was about to hit. I turned to look at my brother and noticed that he was doubled over, hands clutching his ears. I started to make my way to him when the sound repeated, only this time it was clear. \n \"LARRY TAYLOR, I SUMMON YOU.\" There was no doubt about it, that was my name. This time I felt nothing in my chest and I noticed my brother finally standing upright, with a hugely puzzled look on his face.

Seconds later, the thing opens what I guess is a mouth and I heard my name again, first from the TV and then through the air. \n \"Holy shit man, that thing knows you.\" The receptionist snapped her head to me and asked if I was Larry Taylor. I nodded. She picked up the phone and called someone.", "Standing in the lobby dumbfounded and speechless, we watched what appeared to be an uneasy truce between man and monster. The human response was growing exponentially, with aircraft joining the land military. Hundreds of civilians had shown up as well and some were launching out in kayaks and canoes to paddle towards this giant. It stood motionless after calling my name several more times.", "The police came and asked a simple question; what is your name?

Apparently so.", "My blindfold was removed and after an little adjustment for my eyes I peered out of the back of the transport, noticing that we were on a coastal highway. There didn't appear to be any traffic behind us and I notice that there was no traffic in the opposite lanes either. No one spoke to me, and unless the did so in English, I wouldn't understand them anyway. I wanted to rub my temples and try to shake the fog off from being sedated but my hands were still cuffed behind my back.", "Twenty minutes later the truck slowed to a stop. I heard some chatter but didn't understand it. The truck then lurched forward and I realized that we passed through a checkpoint. Armored trucks pulled forward after we entered this new area, effectively blocking off all other access from the road. My transport was moving slower as well, navigating a maze of people, tents, tanks and other military hardware. Before much longer I was unceremoniously yanked from the troop hauler and shoved in front of a diminutive man. \n \"I am Ammiraglio Christiano Ferilli, commander of Naval Forces Italy. What is your name?\" He fixed me with a stern gaze and I replied, \"Larry Taylor. What do you want with me? Where is my brother? Why am I detained? ANSWER ME!\" \n \"Ah, typical American. Demanding and ignorant of the situation he finds himself in. Let me explain something to you Mr. Taylor, your president has authorized us to detain you and deliver you to the... thing.

That is all the information you need to know.\" With a dismissive wave of his hand I was shoved towards another truck, loaded and being delivered to a town I'd never heard of before.", "Arriving in Santa Tecla was strange. The admiral had called ahead and our path was cleared all the way to the black, rocky beaches in this small village. I was pulled from the truck, again, and blindfolded, again, before being led to the beach. Once there I was forced into a kneeling position and someone behind me snatched off my blindfold. I looked out to the Mediterranean to see a massive tower of beast. The TV cameras did not convey the size of this thing, but now that I had a perspective with my own eyeballs I refused to believe a living being could be such a size.", "Eight hundred feet tall was a low estimate, that's how much of it rose above the water. This monster was easily a thousand feet tall and it was now moving towards me at an impossible rate.", "Panicked screams filled the air when it moved. I heard weapons being cocked, frantic calls going out over radios and more than a few prayers... and here I am, still handcuffed, with this thing moving towards me.", "The huge, muscular beast took steps in two hundred foot spans and was upon me in a matter of moments. It stopped fifty yards or so from the beach, the water barely covering what I guessed were it's toes When it spoke it wasn't the thunderous boom that I'd heard back in Belgium, but it was still loud enough to ring my ears. \n \"Are you the one called Larry Taylor? Speak and answer me!\" \n \"Yes, I am Larry Taylor. What do you want with me? How do you know my name? Why am I here?\" \n \"Stand Larry, and accept your fate.\"", "If I'd had a square asshole just then, I'd have shit a brick. I stood, staring up at the weirdly human and mechanical form. I swallowed and felt my throat click. My heart was racing and somewhere in the back of my brain I was telling myself that this was the end. The monster began to kneel down.", "Off behind my left shoulder I heard a gunshot. I flinched, thinking I was the target. Well, that one shot turned into more, and pretty soon it seemed like everyone in Santa Tecla was firing away. A tank, or maybe it was artillery, fired and I watched the impact appear on the colossus's shoulder. I was shaking with fear, fear that the humans behind me would mow me down and fear that the monster would step on me trying to get to them. I couldn't think, so I ran.", "I took off along the beach, northeast towards the small marina there, hoping I could make it before I died. I didn't make it far.", "The ground shook so hard I lost my footing and spilled on the rocks. The sound that accompanied the quake would have knocked me off my feet anyway; an earth shattering roar that made me think the world had fractured. I looked up in the direction of the marina and saw a tank crash into the beach. Bodies, trees, and dirt were flying around everywhere. I heard the telltale sound of a jet engine failing and rockets firing. This little piece of seafront island had just turned into a version of Hell.", "I turned over and sat on my ass, watching the beast from the briny depths pull his hands from the earth. I'm guessing he'd jumped onto land and slammed his fists down, but it didn't seem like that simple tantrum-like act could destroy so much.", "I yelled at the top of my lungs \"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?\" The four-legged creature stopped, turned his massive head and fixed me with a red-eye gaze. When it spoke this time, it spoke in my head. \n \"Far above this earth, beyond the stars, there is a beast that comes to destroy you. Only you. You are not who you think you are.\" \n I couldn't think straight, but managed to ask, \"Who are you? Where do you come from?\" \n \"I am the son of the Sun and have no name.

She told me to pray, and ask for forgiveness, and the power of light would come outside of me. \n I promise, I tried to change, I really did. But then, I raised Boots from the dead.", "You remember boots, don't you? She was such the most friendly cat I've ever known... Well remember when she went missing when I was 12, and she was covered in blood? I told you that it was the blood of another cat she got in a fight with that didn't end well... \n I lied.", "I was looking all over for Boots, and eventually I found her. She was dead, an arrow was in her. Some bratty kids used her as target practice and left her for dead. I felt as if I had lost my best friend, and I immediately began to cry, tears swelled up in my eyes and sobs broke out in my throat that I didn't even realize I was capable of making. I cradled her into my arms, and began to shake back and forth, saying, \"Please, no, no, no, no Boots, don't leave me! No!\" \n Before I knew it a warm sensation began to spread through my body, directly into my hands, and then Boots began to squirm in my arms and kiss my cheek when she started purring.", "I was in shock then, but all the fears I had came to life. I was a necromancer, I would never be a healer like you wanted me to. But the thing is, with Boots alive, brought back from the dead, I didn't care.", "I know what you're thinking, you'll think I'll become evil. You'll think I'll be like all the other necromancers, raising bodies from the dead to torment their victims, or even worship the fallen god... but you know me better than that I hope.", "I did research on it and found others like me, necromancers ashamed of who they are, many of them hide behind guises of healers in order to help others without being associated with evil. \n I talked to a man, who I will not name for his own protection, that works in fields. He goes to villages that experience drought, and have trouble growing their grains, and when no one is around he raises the vegetation from the ground, and gives it new life.", "The thing that is misunderstood about necromancy is this: \n You can raise a corpse from the dead, and leave it as it is, often used to terrify the family who of it belonged to, or to do your own bidding. \n But necromancy can also be used as a healing magic, and requires so, so much more skill and patience, and even love.", "I could be the necromancers that do evil, but with practice I could become the healer you always wanted me to be, just in a different way. \n Please give me that choice. The man I talked to said he would accept me into his apprenticeship.", "So there it is. Your child's a necromancer, but I prefer the term \"Healer.\" \n Take with it what you will, but all I ask is you continue to love me. \n Sincerely, \n Yours truly. \n --", "I haven't wrote in a long time, so this is kind of practice.

He was used to being alone in his youth, but he wanted companionship as an adult. He had women. Plenty of women. He slept with women from Europe, Africa, and Asia, traveling the world in the bedroom between their thighs.", "Esther was the same- showing off a new boy toy each weekend at the nicest restaurants. There was Chad, Jimmy, Eric, and Drew. They all looked the same- tall, muscular, with dirty blonde hair. Had they not kept the attention of Esther, they'd be selling underwear on the ads between the pages of magazines that would never sell.", "The two grew tired of these lifestyles and wanted a new routine. William wanted to go home to someone. He was tired of an empty apartment. He tried getting a dog- but he had no time to walk it and his allergies got the best of him. Esther felt the same. She could only have so many glasses of wine for dinner by herself. She wanted conversation. She wanted someone to ask her how her day went, even if she didn't want to talk about it.", "The two met at a wedding of a mutual friend. William went to college with the groom and Esther's cousin was best friends with the bride. They both only went for the sake of appearances.", "William wore a tailored suit that fit him just right. He had his tailor alter each month, especially if he slacked on going to the gym. Esther wore a red cocktail dress that looked more valuable than it was. She had pearls laced around her neck and her hair was up in a tight bun, a single white streak fluttered in her bangs. She had an empty wine glass in her hand, carrying it around like a trophy.", "The two shared a table at the reception. William ordered the steak and Esther ordered the chicken. They both hated the food. Neither ate cake.", "William was immediately drawn to Esther. Her red dress helped her stand out in a crowd of neutral colors. He didn't find her naturally beautiful but he found a comfort in her that he had not experience before. Everyone was intimidated by her, but William had worked with women like her his entire life.

She rose in the ranks faster than anyone before her and she ran with it. She never wanted to be an executive. She wanted to be a librarian. She loved books.

He didn ’ t mind she always skipped breakfast but made sure to get her coffee in the morning. He didn ’ t mind she worked eighty hours a week.", "Esther found a similar comfort in William. She was drawn to his presence- powerful and commanding. She loved how he found wealth after growing up so poor. He was a self-made man and she appreciated that. She found it sexy he would not have to rely on her. He was independent. He was intelligent. He was good company.", "The two agreed to meet again. They never called it a date. The two simply led their separate lives and their meetings were just the intersections of their busy day to day routine. They continued this for a year. \n It wasn ’ t long before they became a part of each other ’ s routine.", "William was never comfortable with the idea of marriage. His wealth had made him weary of any woman who got too close to him and a lawyer at the end of bad break up was the last thing he wanted. Esther didn ’ t want kids. She did not want to marry a man who expected her to help carry on the family name. She could never work at home. She would never work at home.", "As time passed, William ’ s hesitations were dismissed the more time he spent with Esther. He, too, did not want to have kids. He wanted a friend. Someone he could share dinner with and not feel a need to impress. Someone he could fall asleep next to in bed, and find comfort in hearing her breathe next to him. He wanted to wake up next to someone for once and not have to worry about an awkward breakfast. He wanted to hold her.", "Esther echoed William ’ s thoughts.

Snarling faces, twisted bodies, and countless snapping jaws, all ready to rip us to shreds.", "When it was apparent that this was an invasion, the city guards sounded the alarm. Signals were lit, and nervous words exchanged. The demonic horde increased by size every few moments, and were marching steadily towards Panchea.

The demonic army radiated darkness and evil, even while in contrast to the afternoon sky.", "The archers fired arrows at the abominations. Some died instantly, but most did not.

It was the first time some had ever personally seen their nation ’ s prized war-cannons being used. They were hulking beasts, in comparison to the common city cannon which could already easily rip a crowd in half. These war-cannons were able to put literal dents in the sides of mountains.", "And when they were fired towards the colossal beasts, a deafening sound was made.

However, it was still not enough to stop the advance.", "The King ordered a retreat. All commoners and noblemen were to pack essentials and leave immediately. Some were allowed to stay behind to assist in defending the city. The soldiers were to defend the city at all costs, to buy time for our escape.

Although we trusted in their abilities to defend, we had seen what the beasts were capable of.", "Two millions and thirty thousand human lives lost were lost within one day of fighting. The battle was a slaughter, and the victims were our soldiers. Although mighty, they stood no chance against the invaders from the other world.

But then, the valley started shaking.", "They thought that another gateway was being opened, but that wasn ’ t the case. The mountains suddenly erupted from the ground, and out formed four humanoid giants.", "These beings were colossal, titanic and were as large as the gigantic beasts we had seen weeks ago.

Strangely, they all wore what seemed to be traditional battle helmets, from empires lost generations ago.", "They all radiated warmth in the cold winter ’ s air, and the surrounding white snow started melting. Steam emerged off their skin, but did not feel hot to the touch.", "They wasted no time in fighting the demonic soldiers, with one of the titans scooping us up.

{"story": ["John woke up, his eyes struggling as his eyes saw light for the first time in a long time.", "The first thing he saw was an old kindly man, who chuckled as he saw the surprise and excitement in John ’ s eyes. \n “ What … is this? ” \n “ Heaven! The calzones finally did it for you, I think. Dropped dead of a heart attack. ” \n “ Heaven? ” \n “ Yes, heaven. Slightly different from the Pearly Gates you hear about on Earth, but a pretty nice \n place nonetheless. ” \n “ What do you mean? ”", "John looked slightly better. He no longer looked as stupefied as he did when he first saw the heavenly light, and his eyes had adjusted to take in the beautiful scenery: a crystal-clear lake was just in front of him, in the middle of a vividly verdant forest. The sound of birds could be heard as the old man talked, with a glittering smile and a serene happiness. However, beneath that John could see a deep wrenching pain, and so his expression became one of mild apprehension. \n “ We call this place Elysium. In here you can live past your life, free from worldly constraints, and free to do whatever you want for as long as you ’ d like to. I ’ m Mike. ” \n “ Nice… to meet you, Mike. ” \n “ You ’ re a good man, John. The best father I ’ ve seen in probably a decade, and the best husband I ’ ve seen in five thousand years. ” \n John quickly sat up. \n “ Typical. Newbies like you think eternity and think several times a normal human lifespan, and think you can truly comprehend eternity. Eternity is not a millenium: it ’ s endless and eternal. Well, it isn ’ t really eternal: you essentially slow down time so that you can fit ten thousand years in a single human lifespan. ” \n “ Well what do I do here? ” \n “ Most people follow a fairly regular afterlife progression.", "For the first seventy-five or a hundred years, most are still attached to their earthly lives, like infants who can ’ t leave the caress of their mother ’ s arms. They see who comes to their funeral, follow their siblings and their friends through life. They see people get along with their lives without them in it. This stage ends when one of two things happen: their family and friends die off, or they grow jaded at never being able to say a single word to those who want so badly to hear their voice again, being an inch away but a dimension apart. ” Tears formed in Mike ’ s eyes as he said this, leading John to suspect Mike fell into the latter category. \n “ For the next couple of millennia, their minds turn to knowledge. This is a required phase: throughout the books all of humanity has written throughout history, every discipline they master, every experience they go through, they learn the wisdom to deal with the onus of immortality. They creep, like a snail, unwillingly every other day to a designated center of learning, where they read every book ever written, look at every painting ever painted, and stuff like that. The schoolboys, as we call them, are usually not happy about the arrangement. \n “ Well then why do you make them do it? ” \n “ To teach them how to behave as a citizen in the kingdom of the skies. To teach them how to act. ” \n “ OK, that sounds like a drag… ” \n “ Never much of a bookworm? ” \n “ Yeah. ” \n “ Neither was I. You learn to like it. ” \n “ OK, go on. ” \n “ At this point, they have sufficiently renounced their old ties to the world below to find new people. They find a lover and marry, often several times, to find the perfect match. This usually takes about a century. In heaven, people are nicer: I think it ’ s the humility that comes from having already died once, and also of course that we ’ ve separated the wheat from the chaff. Some people get carried away, though: they write poems to their girlfriend ’ s eyebrows or crap like that. ” Mike smiled as he said this and John chuckled. \n “ Next, they fight. ” \n “ Why fight? Isn ’ t this heaven? ” \n “ False advertising. It ’ s our job to keep Earth from going to hell, no pun intended. We fight the forces of hell to keep Earth from falling into chaos and destruction.", "Soldiering changes you up here. Although for most folks it ’ s weeded out of them in the first millennia, some are still sons of bitches deep down inside: jealous of honor, sudden and quick in quarrel. Some are vainglorious and desperately trying to impress their fellow man even in the cannon ’ s mouth. This is mandatory for a thousand years, but some stay longer. Don ’ t worry about the time for now: over the years, time seems to pass faster. ” \n John no longer looked apprehensive, but an almost bemused expression now was on his face. \n “ Ely-whatever sure has a lot of rules! ” \n “ Trust me, they ’ re good things, rules. Keep everyone happy. \n Anyway, on with the spiel. Next is the judgment phase.", "When people die, they have to either go to heaven or hell. You don ’ t take part in this trial, though. You get a lawyer and a judge and jury decide your fate. If you go to hell, the judge and jury also decide your punishments and penance. You ’ ll have learned law at this point, and you don ’ t forget things in Elysium, so you ’ ll be at turns lawyer, judge, jury, and executioner. ” \n “ Executioner?! ” \n “ You have to introduce dead people to their new home, either heaven or hell, and show them the ropes, like I ’ m doing right now. You ’ re close to my millionth defendant, I think: they throw you a party or something for the perfect million, so I ’ ve heard. They give you really fancy suits, with well-lined pockets. Most people here are proud of how far they ’ ve gotten, but they aren ’ t always as vivacious as they once were: you age in heaven, just very slowly. “", "Mike said this last part with disdain, as time had not treated him well: his formal beard and severe piercing eyes made him look the part of an old lawyer quite well. \n “ Who was the worst person you ever defended and what happened to them? ” \n “ A Redditor I see. You ’ re only the hundredth person to ask that, and they ’ ve all been in the last year. Damn that site. ”", "The worst person I defended was a man who sold fake treatments to ALS patients to scam them out of the last worldly possessions they would ever have. His verdict was decided in record time, and I hardly bothered trying to argue his case. The jury decided to paralyze him and leave him in a single spot for a thousand years, then one day of release, then another thousand forever. They say he went insane. ” \n “ Oh. ” \n “ So after that I can ’ t comment from experience, but I ’ ll tell you what they told me. After that, the world starts to take its toll on you, but we don ’ t have illness up here, so it takes a lot longer. You become lean and almost emaciated. You don ’ t have a job anymore, so you spend the next couple thousand years reading up on what happened while you were fighting and lawyering and judging and loving, and you grow old with your wife. The slippers come on, what was once maybe a deep booming voice becomes full of pipes and whistles, and the world becomes too wide for you. ”", "Mike ’ s tone had become deathly serious over the last couple of sentences, and his eyes became at once fierce and resigned, and deeply, beyond his superficialities, a profound melancholy had pervaded his demeanor. This change prompted John ’ s expression to change from interest and fascination to deep resounding apprehension. \n “ What happens after that? ” \n “ I won ’ t tell you. ” \n With force John angrily replied, “ What is it? Tell me, I demand it! ” \n “ You shouldn ’ t… Please…Don ’ t make me… don ’ t be like the others… ” \n With fury John stood up. Like a cornered dog he lashed out at Mike, screaming. \n “ Just tell me! ” \n “ You don ’ t want me to tell you… ” \n “ Yes! I do! Tell me right now! ” \n With tears in his eyes again, Mike complied. \n “ You can go on after that phase, you know: we have the technology to start the whole ride over again. But at that point, what is there to live for? Most people can ’ t bear to think of the terrible burden of all those years doubled, and can ’ t bear the weight of Father Time on their back for any more. ” \n “ So they die? How can you die in heaven? What happens after that? ” \n “ Mere oblivion, the end of sensation and consciousness, just dust. Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. ” \n A single bird chirped in the distance as a deep pain took root in John ’ s mind. \n "], "outline": ["Your first question upon arriving in the afterlife is , `` what do people do here ?

No thanks. Thank you.\" Dang this smells so good. \n \"Okay, as I was saying, after you left I got into my car with my friend and we went home and had a tea party. Any then we watched a movie and he started to get frisky, we went upstairs to my room, and he said he wanted to take a bath, so we took a bath together. He was AMAZING in the bathtub, and then in bed he was even better. I think I left him out of breath even.\"", "Whoa this lady is terrifying and crazy \"Well sounds like you had a good time. I went home all alone, took a bath alone, and went to bed alone. But the next day I made two friends and we all three had a great time in bed, although they were both a little soft, but it's okay I still had a great time.\" I think I'm starting to like this lady \"Hey maybe you want to go out on the trail with me and we can make a couple of friends and have a party at my house.\" \n \"That would be awesome. How about tomorrow?\" \n \"Tomorrow sounds great, what time do you want to go out?\" \n \"How about at 9 in the morning?\" \n \"Sure sounds good.\" Ha, we're going to have a good time alright. \"Okay well I'm done with my food, and I have to go to a meeting for work, but I'll see you tomorrow.\" \n \"Okay, bye.\" \n We are going to have an awesome party I think I'll need to get some supplies though.

Nah that would be rude. \n \"Hey, did you go out and buy supplies? Because I did if you didn't.\"", "Wow maybe she doesn't know how to be polite \"Oh, wow yeah I bought some rope and a shovel.\" Why did I even buy a shovel She probably already has one. \n \"Okay great. It thought about a shovel but I figured you might already have one.\"", "Oh wow, how does she get rid of her bodies then? \"Oh, um okay, good thing I bought one then. Shall we get this party started then?\" \n \"Yeah, let's go.\" \n -- -- -- -- - 6 hours and two male bodies later -- -- -- -- - \n \"Hey, how about we put the bodies in your car since you've got a bigger car.

{"story": ["I don't know how long we had been down here playing... it seemed like days. Our 3.5 D & D game had hit an apex sometimes last night and the DM's story just didn't let up. Joey was like that. He was an AMAZING story teller, it's just he had no idea about where to end it for the night... and we, the heathens that we were, had no idea when to call it quits. It was almost a battle of wills; myself, Jake, Chris and Austin against Joey. \n We liked to play in character so I was decked out in this cool set of chain mail, shirt and viking helmet for my fighter, Jake had on a Robin hood thing for his elf ranger, Chris was just wearing a Pantera shirt and jeans because he was a douche like that. And Austin, much to our uproarious laughter had to wear his sister's tiara and a Xena bra we found in the basement after his character was turned into a woman a few sessions ago. To his credit he rocked that look, taking it all in stride. \n \"... The party opens these massive 15 meter tall wooden doors and enters the temple of Xanagoras. You see an altar at the far end of the temple which has marble floors and torches running down either side of its walls. \"Joey said \n\" I roll perception for hidden enemies \"Jake said \n\" You find- \" I'll never know what Joey was about to say there because at that moment something burst through the wall. I want you to realize the full extent of what bursting through the wall of a basement means. This thing came through the wall, it's tan-brown leathery hide jiggled grotesquely as it got it's bearings in the basement. It let out a roar that sounded as if it were a cross between something out of Jurassic Park, a snarling wolf, a cement mixer full of rocks and a freight train horn. I felt it's roar inside my chest, the rumble seemed to mix with the pounding of my heart trying to escape my chest.", "Everytime I tell this story I get ashamed of myself, that I just sat there, mouth agape, not even lifting a finger when the thing reared up and came down on the upper half of Joey's body and dragged him, kicking through that hole. We all ran away, ran to the ground floor of the house and our first instinct was to call the police, the Army, the CIA, FBI, NSA, CDC, hell the fucking TSA we didn't care we were terrified as children.", "The Jake looked out of the front window and saw overturned cars, a fire hydrant spraying water into the air, a house on fire midway up the road and the asphalt street cracked in a line that meandered back and forth across its length. The line erupted in a similarly sized hole and a bloodstain, almost as a punctuation mark. We looked further out, down the hill and into the Bay Area and... well the city was on fire.", "Giant columns of smoke rose from gutted buildings and we could make out the flashing lights of various emergency services. We couldn't believe our eyes... this wasn't happening. What the hell is going on? The far off rumbling vibrated the air near our faces as a skyscraper down by the water seemed to have it's right side give out from under it, it fell for maybe fifty feet before it hit something sturdy but by then it was already at an extreme angle, the force caused the stop section to break off and go plummeting to the ground.", "Chris simply slumped to the ground against the wall and pitched a fit like a child. \"This can't be happening! This can't be happening! No! No! No! Please No!\" He beat his fists against the wall and the floor, hysterical and screaming. He was a strong guy, the floors shook with the impacts. Behind me I saw the street begin to erupt and jagged pieces of asphalt, and then sidewalk flew upward from what was certainly one of those things... \n I ran."], "outline": ["Write about a group of post-apocalyptic survivors who are have just found out the apocalypse has happened", [["apex sometimes last night", "freight train horn", "robin hood thing", "cement mixer full", "moment something burst"], ["upper half", "thing reared", "mouth agape"], ["fire hydrant spraying water", "similarly sized hole", "saw overturned cars"], ["various emergency services", "right side give", "maybe fifty feet"], ["sidewalk flew upward", "chris simply slumped", "things"]]]}
